# Collaborative_Filtering
This program defines a CollaborativeFiltering class that represents a collaborative filtering recommendation system. It has methods to initialize the system, fit the system to a set of ratings, and predict a rating for a user and an item.

The collaborative filtering algorithm uses matrix factorization to learn latent factors for users and items based on the observed ratings. The fit method updates the user and item factors using stochastic gradient descent with regularization.

In the main block, a small ratings dataset is created and used to train a CollaborativeFiltering object with two latent factors. Then, the rating for user 0 and item 2 is predicted and printed.

This program demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to implement complex systems like recommendation systems.
